This is the website code I wrote for the very cool digital artist [Integra](https://twitter.com/integratunes), featuring free art asset downloads and premium merchandise.

Fully custom HTML, CSS and JS. Coolest technical achievement here is the cart system, which is fully local and stores cart data in a Javascript object, and generates a Shopify checkout link for checking out. Technically, this setup could be hosted on static web hosting since adding and removing cart items doesn't communicate with a server. This also makes the shopping experience more responsive, and allows us to use the cheapest Shopify Lite plan while also having complete control over our website. Win-win for everyone honestly.
